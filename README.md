# Vadati

 Vadati: The chrome extension for focused, distraction-free productivity.

 ## How It's Made : 
 ### Tech used : 
 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 - React JS
 - localstorage API, with **useLocalStorage hook**
 - Unsplash API, OpenWeatherAPI
 - **Voice to Text** using **SpeechSynthesisAPI** which will be published as an **npm package** soon
  
 
 ### Motivation:
 As a programmer, I often spend a lot of time using my browser and integrated development environment (IDE). However, I found the default browser (Edge/Chrome) to be visually unappealing and rarely used the search bar.
 <br>
 <br>
 In search of a better extension, I stumbled upon [momentum](https://momentumdash.com/). While it was helpful, it had too many unnecessary features and seemed cluttered. 
 I decided to create my own extension, incorporating a **voice input feature** for convenience. This led to the development of Vadati, a chrome extension designed to **remove distractions** and help users **focus on a single task**.

 P.S. - Vadati in sanskrit means speaking :grin:

 ### Lessons Learned : 
 - The importance of simplicity and user experience while implementing the local storage auth 
 - The value of leveraging API's and third-party services
 - Use of env variables, and how to store and manage them secretly while deploying  
 
 ## Future Improvments:
 
 - Optimize the loading of background images by implementing lazy loading.
 - Host and serve optimized images through a cloud service like Cloudinary rather than using the Unsplash API.
 - Add a to-do list feature in the bottom-right corner for tracking additional tasks.
 - Implement a Google login feature to store daily progress.
 - Research and consider alternative approaches to using the useEffect hook for fetching images and weather data."
